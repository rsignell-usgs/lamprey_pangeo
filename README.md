# Demonstration of Danger for ecosystem data

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how Pangeo may be used with Ecosystem Mission Area data.
The example also highlights needs for approaches such as Pangeo to be more widely adapted by USGS scientists, especially those in EMA. 

## Overview of files and use

This script requires [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 
USGS users may use [Pangeo](http://pangeo.chs.usgs.gov/). 
The data comes from [ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/) and was part of a MS Thesis examining how eDNA correlates to sea lamprey stocking densities. 
This repository contains the follow files:

- `README.md`: This file
- `Example_integrated_data.ipynb`: The example Jupyter Notebook

To use the example, open the example notebook and follow along and run the script.

## Required user skill set

**Coding:** This example requires the a user to understand how to use Jupyter Notebooks. 
For users who are unfamiliar, many online tutorials exist. 

**Statistics:** This example assumes the user is familiar with basic regression and boxplots. 


## Limitations and questions for Rich Signell

- `code.usgs.gov` vs `code.chs.usgs.gov`
- Getting large datasets to cloud? e.g., genomics data
- R Kernel for Jupyter notebook
- Can we use our own custom Docker image to run our Jupyter notebook?
